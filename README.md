# Block Sandbox Game (Ursina Engine)

A simple Minecraft-inspired sandbox built with [Ursina](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) in Python.  
This project was created for fun to explore block placement, destruction, and first-person controls.

## Features
- First-person movement (WASD keys)
- Jump with Shift
- Place blocks with left mouse click
- Destroy blocks with right mouse click
- Grass-textured cubes arranged in a grid
- Infinite gravity (fall endlessly) — intentional design choice
- Optional walls can be added if needed

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Ursina Engine (`pip install ursina`)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
